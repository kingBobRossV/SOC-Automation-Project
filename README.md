# SOC-Automation-Project

## Objective

To design and implement a fully automated Security Operations Center (SOC) environment by deploying a complete Wazuh SIEM instance integrated with SOAR capabilities for real-time alert handling and response orchestration. This project also includes the configuration of a fully functional case management system using TheHive, enabling analysts to seamlessly triage, investigate, and track incidents. The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end SOC workflow automation—from detection to response and documentation—using open-source tools.

### Skills Learned

-SIEM Deployment & Configuration
Set up and fine-tuned a production-grade Wazuh SIEM for log aggregation, threat detection, and real-time alerting.

-SOAR Integration
Integrated Wazuh with SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) tools to automate incident response workflows and reduce analyst fatigue.

-Case Management System Implementation
Deployed and customized TheHive for incident tracking, case enrichment, and collaborative investigation workflows.

-Threat Intelligence Automation
Connected TheHive to external threat intel sources (e.g., MISP, VirusTotal) to automatically enrich alerts and support decision-making.

### Tools Used

-Wazuh – Open-source SIEM for log analysis, intrusion detection, and compliance monitoring

-TheHive – Scalable and collaborative incident response platform for case management

-Cortex – Automated analysis engine connected to TheHive for running enrichment and response actions

-Elasticsearch – Backend search engine supporting Wazuh's data indexing and querying

-Kibana – Data visualization dashboard for viewing and analyzing security events from Wazuh

-Logstash – Data processing pipeline for collecting, parsing, and forwarding logs
